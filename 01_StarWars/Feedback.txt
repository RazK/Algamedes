General Grade Distribution:
+15 - Code is compiling
+15 - Compiling & not raising exceptions/errors
+10 - Compiling & no logical errors & bugs
+5 - Compiling & no warnings
+5 - Consistent coding conventions & readability

Exercise Specific:
+10 - README (student details and description of your strategies)
+40 - Spaceship(s) (strategy and implementation)

Key Points to Notice:
# Don't forget to describe the strategy of each ship in the README.
# After you've got something working and you're happy with it - clean it up and remove unused or duplicated code.
# Document WHAT your code is trying to do, not HOW (unless the HOW is complicated to understand from reading the code).
# Try to match the coding conventions of the code you're working with (for example, use PascalCase and not camelCase for method names) but most importantly, be consistent with your conventions.

Tips:
# The ship doesn't have to react only to the current situation. Try to have it "remember" it's plan or chosen strategy.
# Use your shield smartly! it can be crucial to your success.
# Don't assume both of your ships will exist in the same battle (but you can take advantage of the chance if they do...)
# Run a match with just one of your ships and the "Player" ship to test your ship's performance.
# There are some hidden achievements that can grant you bonuses, so - think big!
